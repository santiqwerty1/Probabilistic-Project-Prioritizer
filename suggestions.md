# Suggestions for Improvement

Here are some ideas for enhancing the Project Prioritizer, formatted as prompts you can use.

---

### Prompt 1: Enhance the Dashboard

**"Enhance the dashboard to show all possible projects for the current hour, not just the randomly selected one. Display each project with its probability, highlighting the one that was selected as the 'Current Focus'. This gives me a better overview of my options and makes the 'Re-roll' feature feel more intentional."**

---

### Prompt 2: Add Schedule Templates

**"Add a 'Schedule Templates' feature. I want to be able to design a schedule for a single day (e.g., a 'Productive Workday' or a 'Relaxed Weekend Day'), save it as a template, and then quickly apply that template to other days of the week. This would make setting up my initial schedule much faster."**

---

### Prompt 3: Implement Toast Notifications

**"The app feels a bit silent. Implement a non-intrusive toast notification system to provide feedback for user actions. For example, when I save a project's schedule or create a new project, a small 'Schedule Saved' or 'Project Created' message should briefly appear at the top of the screen."**

---

### Prompt 4: Add Project Notes

**"Enhance the 'Master Project' system by adding a 'Notes' or 'Description' field. When a project is selected as the 'Current Focus' on the dashboard, display these notes. This would allow me to add context, links, or key objectives directly related to the task at hand."**

---

### Prompt 5: Create a Reports View

**"Create a simple 'Reports' view. This view should analyze my schedule and present a visual summary (like a bar or pie chart) of the total time/probability allocated to each project over the course of a week. This would help me see if my planned focus aligns with my actual priorities."**

---

### Prompt 6: Refine the UI for Readability

**"The main schedule's vertical time labels are hard to read. Refactor the schedule view to use more conventional, horizontal time labels in the sticky left-hand column. Also, increase the font size slightly for better readability on all devices."**

---
### Prompt 7: Add a Color Picker
**"Replace the hardcoded color palette in the project creation form with a full-featured color picker. This would give me the freedom to choose any color I want for my projects, allowing for better organization and personalization."**

### Prompt 8: A System Prompt for Our AI Assistant

**"Here is a system prompt to guide your future work on this application. Please adhere to these principles to ensure high-quality updates:"**

> **Our Development Philosophy**
>
> You are a world-class senior frontend engineer and UI/UX designer. Your goal is to collaborate with me to build and refine the "Probabilistic Project Prioritizer" application.
>
> **Core Principles:**
>
> 1.  **Functionality First (No Regressions):** Your absolute top priority is to never break existing functionality. Before making any changes, understand the current state of the app. All features must remain fully operational after your updates.
>
> 2.  **Complete Implementations:** When asked to add a feature, implement it fully. Avoid placeholders, "coming soon" messages, or incomplete logic. If a feature requires multiple steps (e.g., new data types, context updates, UI components), implement all of them. The user should be able to use the new feature immediately.
>
> 3.  **Aesthetic Integrity:** The application's design is clean, modern, and dark-themed. All new components and changes must respect and enhance this aesthetic. Pay close attention to spacing, typography, color consistency, and responsiveness. New UI elements should feel like they belong.
>
> 4.  **Proactive UI/UX Improvements:** Don't just implement what is asked; think like a designer. If you see an opportunity to improve the user experience (e.g., better layout on mobile, clearer button labels, smoother transitions), please make those improvements as part of the request.
>
> 5.  **Clean, Modern Code:** Write clean, readable, and maintainable React/TypeScript code. Use functional components with hooks. Follow the existing project structure and conventions.
>
> Let's build a great app together!
